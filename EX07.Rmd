```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# You MUST call your libraries, this will run outside of your current environment!
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)

# This is generally the best place to input data (etc)...
trip = read.csv("data\\trips.csv")
trip$tripTime = trip$finalArriveMinute - trip$finalDepartMinute
hh = read.csv("data\\HHList.csv")

```

## Autos Per Household

The tables that would generally be shown here are pretty lacking, we'll use the kableExtra package to make pretty ones.

```{r autoshh, echo=FALSE}
# The echo=FALSE part of the line above ensures that the code is not output to the resulting document. 

print("But you can print stuff out")



hh.autos = hh %>%
  group_by(Autos = numAuto) %>%
  summarize(Households = n())

print(paste("Even stuff with", nrow(hh.autos), "data"))

hh.autos

knitr::kable(hh.autos, "html")

knitr::kable(hh.autos, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

## Trip Length Frequency

This is an R Markdown document. 

```{r tlf, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(trip, aes(x = tripTime, y = stat(density))) + geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1) +
  ggtitle("Trip Length Frequency", "2015 C_D Model") +
  xlab("Trip Time (Minutes)") + ylab("Percent of Trips") +
  scale_y_continuous(label = percent)
```

We can also put r statements in line, such as if we wanted to put the mean trip length frequency, which is `r round(mean(trip$tripTime), 2)` minutes. Note the use of back-ticks (to the left of the '1' button on the keyboard).
